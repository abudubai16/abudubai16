### 👨‍🎓: About Me :
  I am a sophomore at National Institure of Technology, Warangal. Some of the stuff I have worked on as well as currently working on are here. Looking forward to newer and more exciting projects. 
### 🛠️: Languages and Tools :
  I mostly use python due to my interest in machine learning, therefore I use a lot of OpenCV, Tensorflow, Numpy alongside multiprocessing and threading to parallelize the load. Other than python I had given javascript, HTML and CSS a shot over 2-3 weeks so I understand the basics. I have also extensively used C++(3+ years) and Java(5 years) throughtout my school years as well as college.
